== Campanify

Campanify is used to serve Greenpeace worldwide, for their several successfull campaigns e.g. Save The Arctic, Volkswagen Dark Side, Liga das Florestas, Bir Milyon Kahraman and so on.

This repository is the core app where users can manage their app instances (see https://github.com/hackberry-gh/campanify-app). It's designed to hack heroku at the time it was possible, due to their API changes everything is obsolete and semi broken now, and Campanify as a platform has already abandoned at 2014.
